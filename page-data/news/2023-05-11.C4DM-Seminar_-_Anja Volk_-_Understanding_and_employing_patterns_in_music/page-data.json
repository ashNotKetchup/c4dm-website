Her work has helped bridge the gap between scientific and humanistic approaches while working in interdisciplinary research teams in Germany, the USA and the Netherlands. Anja has co-founded several international initiatives, most notably the International Society for Mathematics and Computation in Music (SMCM), the flagship journal of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval (TISMIR), and the Women in MIR (WIMIR) mentoring program, which organizes yearly mentoring rounds with participants from academia and industry, in order to foster greater diversity in MIR. She is also committed to connecting different research communities and providing interdisciplinary education for the next generation through the organization of international workshops, such as the Lorentz Center in Leiden workshops on music similarity (2015), computational ethnomusicology (2017) and music, computing, and health (2019).</p>\n<p><b>Abstract</b>:\nIn this talk, I present research of the Music Information Computing group at Utrecht University on investigating musical patterns with computational means to enhance our understanding of music, and to employ these patterns within different interaction contexts. Starting with computational music analysis dedicated to pattern discovery, I will discuss then the bridge to employing patterns for training in education and health, such as in music-based games for visually impaired children, musical attention control training, and collaborative games for the rhythmic training of children with autism.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"C4DM Seminar: Anja Volk","date":"Wednesday, 15 February 2023","author":"Admin","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#e8e8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/c4dm-website/static/da5db3a8ddd656d9712dbbd89514fbfc/97a19/anjavolk.jpg","srcSet":"/c4dm-website/static/da5db3a8ddd656d9712dbbd89514fbfc/73bb6/anjavolk.jpg 120w,\n/c4dm-website/static/da5db3a8ddd656d9712dbbd89514fbfc/f9edd/anjavolk.jpg 240w,\n/c4dm-website/static/da5db3a8ddd656d9712dbbd89514fbfc/97a19/anjavolk.jpg 480w","sizes":"(min-width: 480px) 480px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/c4dm-website/static/da5db3a8ddd656d9712dbbd89514fbfc/507b0/anjavolk.webp 120w,\n/c4dm-website/static/da5db3a8ddd656d9712dbbd89514fbfc/8d565/anjavolk.webp 240w,\n/c4dm-website/static/da5db3a8ddd656d9712dbbd89514fbfc/21b1a/anjavolk.webp 480w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 480px) 480px, 100vw"}]},"width":480,"height":480}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/news/2023-05-11.C4DM-Seminar_-_Anja Volk_-_Understanding_and_employing_patterns_in_music","breadcrumb":{"location":"/news/2023-05-11.C4DM-Seminar_-_Anja Volk_-_Understanding_and_employing_patterns_in_music/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/news","crumbLabel":"news"},{"pathname":"/news/2023-05-11.C4DM-Seminar_-_Anja Volk_-_Understanding_and_employing_patterns_in_music","crumbLabel":"2023-05-11.C4DM-Seminar_-_Anja Volk_-_Understanding_and_employing_patterns_in_music"}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["908586835"],"slicesMap":{}}
